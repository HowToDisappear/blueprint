Mukherjee was one of the pioneers of Indian modern art and a key figure of Contextual Modernism. He was one of the earliest artists in modern India to take up to murals as a mode of artistic expression. All his murals depict a subtle understanding of environmental through pioneering architectural nuances.\r\n\r\nHis style was a complex fusion of idioms absorbed from Western modern art and the spirituality of oriental traditions (both Indian and Far-Eastern). Some of his works show a marked influence of Far-Eastern traditions, namely calligraphy and traditional wash techniques of China and Japan. He took lessons in calligraphy from travelling artists from Japan. During 1937-38 he spent a few months in Japan with artists such as Arai Kamp\u014d. Similarly he also learnt from the Indian miniature paintings in the frescoes of Mughal and Rajput periods. Idioms of Western modern art also bore heavily upon his style, as he is often seen to blend Cubist techniques (such as multi-perspective and faceting of planes) to solve problems of space. Above all, his style was celebrated and acclaimed because of the harmonious blend he achieved out of all these different traditions. His grand murals inside the Visva-Bharati campus are testimony to that. In 1948 he went to become director of National Museum of Kathmandu, in Nepal. In the later years he went to Doon valley, where he started an art school but had to discontinue due to the financial shortage.\r\n\r\nIn 1972 Mukherjee's former student at Santiniketan, filmmaker Satyajit Ray, made a documentary film on him titled \"The Inner Eye\".

As a merchant seaman in the early 1950s he visited Havana, Mexico and South America. He was a student at the Academy of Fine Art, Vienna in 1951. He attended the Ruskin School, Oxford in 1958-9, and the Royal College of Art from 1959 to 1961. It was at the Royal College that he met David Hockney, who became a close friend.\r\n\r\nKitaj had a significant influence on British pop art, with his figurative paintings featuring areas of bright colour, economic use of line and overlapping planes which made them resemble collages, but eschewing most abstraction and modernism. Allusions to political history, art, literature and Jewish identity often recur in his work, mixed together on one canvas to produce a collage effect. He also produced a number of screen-prints with printer Chris Prater. He told Tony Reichardt, manager of the Marlborough New London Gallery, that he made screen-prints as sketches for his future paintings. From then onwards Tony Reichardt commissioned Chris Prater to print three or four copies of every print he made on canvas. His later works became more personal.\r\n\r\nKitaj was recognised as being one of the world's leading draftsmen, almost on a par with, or compared to, Degas. Indeed, he was taught drawing at Oxford by Percy Horton, whom Kitaj claimed was a pupil of Walter Sickert, who was a pupil of Degas; and the teacher of Degas studied under Ingres. Meanwhile, Edgar Wind encouraged him to become a 'Warburgian artist'. His more complex compositions build on his line work using a montage practice, which he called 'agitational usage'. Kitaj often depicts disorienting landscapes and impossible 3D constructions, with exaggerated and pliable human forms. He often assumes a detached outsider point of view, in conflict with dominant historical narratives. This is best portrayed by his masterpiece \"The Autumn of Central Paris\" (1972\u201373), wherein philosopher Walter Benjamin is portrayed, as both the orchestrator and victim of historical madness. The futility of historical progress creates a disjointed architecture that is maddening to deconstruct.[citation needed] He staged a major exhibition at Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1965, and a retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. in 1981. He selected paintings for an exhibition, \"The Artist's Eye\", at the National Gallery, London in 1980.

Changes in the urban landscape, the result of construction work or more naturally, fluctuations in the weather and seasons, are a central theme in his work. In the 1950s he began painting building sites in various areas of London, including the City and the West End. Railway landscapes in areas familiar to the artist such as Kings Cross, Camden Town, Willesden and Dalston have been painted repeatedly in changing light. Local swimming pools filled with children and more recently, the crowds thronging the entrance of an underground station, have also featured. Portraits and nudes have provided a complementary contrast to architectural and street scenes. Kossoff was significantly influenced by David Bomberg (1890-1957), who taught him briefly in the early 1950s, famously advocating a quest for \u2018the spirit in the mass\u2019 (Moorhouse p.12). This calls for representation of the tactile sense of the subject rather than a visually accurate depiction, uniting a deep emotional response with an exploration of the qualities of materials over and above the accuracy of an image. In the 1950s and \u201860s, Kossoff developed a method of working with paint in some ways similar to that practised by Frank Auerbach (born 1931), his close friend. Both produce paintings in which the solid materiality of the paint is emphasised. While Auerbach frequently works on canvas, Kossoff always works on board and scrapes the paint off with a knife before reapplying it. The thick mass of paint smothering each board and extending over its edges is the result of a few hours energetic and concentrated work. The painting may be worked on over several months, but what is visible, the final state, is accomplished very quickly. Brushstrokes appear expressively gouged into a moist, living bed of paint rather than being applied cleanly onto a hard surface. Colours blend and marbleise with the stroke of the brush in an orgiastic celebration of the sensuality of matter which, at times, pushes the image to the extreme limits of being recognisable. Threads of thick oily paint are allowed to streak over already richly textured surfaces adding to their tactility and emphasising their material nature. Finally, Kossoff stops work on a landscape painting \u2018when I can\u2019t go on or when the painting begins to look like the drawing made on that day or when the image opens up a dialogue with the possibility of starting another version\u2019 (quoted in Leon Kossoff: Recent Paintings, p.18).", "wiki": "Leon_Kossoff"}}, {"model": "gallery.artist", "pk": 5, "fields": {"fname": "Roy", "lname": "Lichtenstein", "born": 1923, "died": 1997, "bio": "Roy Fox Lichtenstein (; October 27, 1923 \u2013 September 29, 1997) was an American pop artist. During the 1960s, along with Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and James Rosenquist among others, he became a leading figure in the new art movement. His work defined the premise of pop art through parody. Inspired by the comic strip, Lichtenstein produced precise compositions that documented while they parodied, often in a tongue-in-cheek manner. His work was influenced by popular advertising and the comic book style. He described pop art as \"not 'American' painting but actually industrial painting\". His paintings were exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City.\r\n\r\nWhaam! and Drowning Girl are generally regarded as Lichtenstein's most famous works. Drowning Girl, Whaam!, and Look Mickey are regarded as his most influential works. His most expensive piece is Masterpiece, which was sold for $165 million in January 2017.\r\n\r\nLichtenstein's works based on enlarged panels from comic books engendered a widespread debate about their merits as art. Lichtenstein himself admitted, \"I am nominally copying, but I am really restating the copied thing in other terms. In doing that, the original acquires a totally different texture. It isn't thick or thin brushstrokes, it's dots and flat colours and unyielding lines.\" Eddie Campbell blogged that \"Lichtenstein took a tiny picture, smaller than the palm of the hand, printed in four color inks on newsprint and blew it up to the conventional size at which 'art' is made and exhibited and finished it in paint on canvas.\" With regard to Lichtenstein, Bill Griffith once said, \"There's high art and there's low art.

Born into a family of artists, Calder's work first gained attention in Paris in the 1920s and was soon championed by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, resulting in a retrospective exhibition in 1943. Major retrospectives were also held at the Solomon R.

From 1970 to 1973 he did postgraduate research at the Courtauld Institute, University of London. In 1974 he accepted his first teaching position, at Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, subsequently teaching at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, 1976-87, and since 1987 at the University of British Columbia.

He felt that, due to what he saw as the dominance of photography and film, it was no longer possible for modern artists to paint like the great masters. Seeking a new method to represent everyday life pictorially, Wall found a suitable medium in advertising hoarding lightboxes, and made his first backlit transparencies in 1978. Early works, such as The Thinker (1986) based on Rodin's sculpture of that name, referred directly to great works in the history of art.

After attending the K\u00f6nigliche Kunstschule in Berlin from 1913 to 1915, he was certified as an art teacher. Albers studied art in Essen and Munich before entering the Bauhaus in Weimar in 1920. There, he initially concentrated on glass painting, and in 1929, as a journeyman, he reorganized the glass workshop. In 1923, he began to teach the Vorkurs, a basic design course. When the Bauhaus moved to Dessau in 1925, he became a professor. In addition to working in glass and metal, he designed furniture and typography.\r\n\r\nAfter the Bauhaus was forced to close in 1933, Albers emigrated to the United States. That same year, he became head of the art department at the newly established, experimental Black Mountain College, near Asheville, North Carolina. Albers continued to teach at Black Mountain until 1949. In 1935, he took the first of many trips to Mexico, where he encountered the art and architecture of ancient Mesoamerica. He and his wife, the artist Anni Albers (1899\u20131994), would go on to visit Mexico and other Latin American countries more than a dozen times between 1935 and the late 1960s. On each visit, Albers took hundreds of black-and-white photographs of the numerous archeological sites and monuments they saw. He often created photocollages with these images, such as Monte Alb\u00e1n (ca. 1956), grouping multiple prints and sometimes postcards of various sizes in grid-like compositions on sheets of paperboard. In 1936, he was given his first solo show in New York at J. B. Neumann\u2019s New Art Circle. Albers became a United States citizen in 1939.

Trained in the art of contemporary miniature painting at the prestigious National College of Art in Lahore, Pakistan, and in mural painting and calligraphy at Tehran University, Iran, Ali is inspired by his rich cultural heritage and employs traditional artistic techniques to convey the complex history of this region. His work provocatively confronts the social and religious prejudice his family has faced and considers its effect on the writing of history, particularly during wartime.\r\n\r\nIn this series, Ali references the thousand-year-old Persian epic the Shahnameh (Book of Kings), one of the greatest masterpieces of world literature. For centuries, this text has served as inspiration for artists, particularly those from Iran, Afghanistan, and northwestern Pakistan; as a young child, Ali would sit by his grandfather as he sang its vivid sagas. Composed of some fifty thousand verses, the Shahnameh recounts the myths, legends, and history of Iran from the beginning of time to the Arab conquest in the seventh century. One of its mythological heroes is Rustam, the powerful winged god of Persia, known for his extraordinary strength, bravery, and loyalty.\r\n\r\nAs part of an ethnic minority known as the Hazara, Ali\u2019s family was attacked repeatedly by the Taliban, a fundamentalist Muslim group that controlled much of Afghanistan. Ali has used his art to respond to this brutality. Through the medium of miniature painting, he explores storytelling and reveals how established cultural icons can be subverted to serve multiple ends in contemporary life and politics. The work stems from an encounter Ali had with a young boy named Rustam who was unaware that his namesake was a mythological character from the Shahnameh. His only association with his name was through the Taliban, who used it to enforce an image of omnipresent vigilance. By associating itself with the kings and heroes of the past, the Taliban seeks to cast itself as an organization of legitimate rulers. Ali inserts personal symbols to counter the hijacking of his culture. For instance, the red rope in some of his works is a memorial to those who were killed under the Taliban regime.

Originally emigrating to Portland, Oregon from Russia with his family, Rothko later moved to New York City where his youthful period of artistic production dealt primarily with urban scenery. In response to World War II, Rothko's art entered a transitional phase during the 1940s, where he experimented with mythological themes and Surrealism to express tragedy. Toward the end of the decade Rothko painted canvases with regions of pure color which he further abstracted into rectangular color forms, the idiom he would use for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nIn his later career Rothko executed several canvases for three different mural projects. The Seagram Murals were to have decorated the Four Seasons Restaurant in the Seagram Building, but Rothko eventually grew disgusted with the idea that his paintings would be decorative objects for wealthy diners and refunded the lucrative commission, donating the paintings to museums including the Tate Modern. The Harvard Mural series was gifted to a dining room in Harvard's Holyoke Center (now Smith Campus Center); their colors faded badly over time due to Rothko's use of the pigment Lithol Red together with regular sunlight exposure.

Kitaj wrote the following text to accompany the painting's exhibition in the 1994 Tate Gallery retrospective:\r\n\r\nSandra and I were married in the beautiful old Sephardic Synagogue founded in London by Rembrandt's friend, Menasseh ben Israel. Under the chupa (canopy), aside from my children and the Rabbi in top hat, Freud is on the left, Auerbach in the middle, then Sandra and me, and Hockney (best man) is to the right of us.

On the left, wearing a top hat, is the Rabbi Abraham Levy, his face partially obscured.

(The son of Kitaj and Sandra, Max was born a year after the marriage.)\r\nKitaj has described Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon as 'the most important influence' on this picture, 'not a source but a hovering presence' (unpublished Board note presented to Tate Gallery Trustees, July 1993). The Wedding brings together several crucial themes in Kitaj's art and thought, including his increasing awareness of his identity as a Jew. The prominent depiction of several of the so-called 'School of London' artists relates to Kitaj's identification of these artists as part of a group of painters who were linked by friendship, their response to great masters, their emphasis on drawing and their concern with the human subject."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 14, "fields": {"artist": 3, "title": "The Murder of Rosa Luxemburg", "ymade": 1960, "medium": "Oil paint, ink, graphite and paper on canvas", "descr": "Rosa Luxemburg was a Jewish activist and founder of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).

Christ Church, Spitalfields, London E1 was built in 1723-9 on what is now the edge of the City. The architect, Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661-1736) was responsible for six Georgian Baroque churches erected in London during the first part of the eighteenth century. Surrounded by rows of brick terraces built by Huguenot settlers in the area, the church is faced in white Portland stone. A flight of steps leads up to the Palladian portico and entrance flanked by massive Tuscan columns. These support an arch, above which the tower and spire soar upwards dramatically. The body of the church consists of a monumental rectangular block which extends backwards for a considerable distance. The weighty and imposing structure of the church body, coupled with the extreme height of its steeple, result in a compositional challenge. Kossoff initially tackled this with a square format. In his earliest paintings of the church, the columns and portico dominate the image while its tower is severely foreshortened and the spire disappears off the canvas. In another version of 1989 the church is crammed diagonally across the canvas. Tate\u2019s version, similarly, depicts the church leaning to the right. On the left side of the painting the edge of a row of houses is roughly indicated. Lamps stick out into the street above a pedestrian in the foreground. Two other figures in front of the church railings and a profusion of leafy green from a tree contribute to an atmosphere of vibrant life. Kossoff has explained his motivation for painting the church:\r\n\r\nThe urgency that drives me to work is not only to do with the pressures of the accumulation of memories and the unique quality of the subject on this particular day but also with the awareness that time is short, that soon the mass of this building will be dwarfed by more looming office blocks and overshadowed, the character of the building will be lost forever, for it is by its monumental flight into unimpeded space that we remember this building."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 18, "fields": {"artist": 4, "title": "Self-Portrait Verso", "ymade": 1967, "medium": "Charcoal on paper.

Kossoff was a student of David Bomberg (whose work is also on show here). Bomberg maintained that there could be no good painting without drawing. In common with Bomberg, drawing is a crucial activity for Kossoff and he draws constantly from the landscape and the figure. Here, the heavily worked surface has been repeatedly erased and re-drawn. This records the artist's many previous attempts to give form to a final definitive image, which is usually executed in one session. The portrait is thus spontaneous, but also founded on accumulated experience of the subject."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 19, "fields": {"artist": 4, "title": "Self-Portrait", "ymade": 1952, "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "descr": "Self-Portrait is a medium-size portrait on canvas that is thickly painted in oils in predominant tones of yellow, red and black. The work is a self-portrait showing the British artist Leon Kossoff as a young man, aged approximately twenty-six years old. Kossoff\u2019s head and neck fill the entire canvas, although he is not immediately recognisable from the work largely due to the loose handling of the brushwork that has resulted in the features appearing blurred and distorted. As such the painting is less a portrait in a conventional sense than an intense evocation of a young man\u2019s expression and emotion, devoid of any social contact or context.\r\n\r\nThis painting was created by Kossoff in London in c.1952. It is painted on a slightly open-weave linen canvas, the texture of which Kossoff has employed as part of the surface of the work. In most areas the paint has been applied straight from the tube in multiple layers using a wet-on-wet technique to create visible impasto and a blending of pictorial forms. However, this effect is not uniform, and in some places the paint is much thinner, for instance in the area just to the right of Kossoff's chin. Kossoff also made use of the brush handle to scrape back through paint layers, as in the strong diagonal line visible in the neck area.\r\n\r\nKossoff made Self-Portrait when he was undertaking art classes at St Martin\u2019s School of Art, London. Between 1950 and 1952 Kossoff also attended evening classes at Borough Polytechnic in London under the tutelage of the British painter David Bomberg. Kossoff found the emphasis on looser brushwork and composition in Bomberg\u2019s lessons a revelation in comparison to the academic formality at St Martin\u2019s, stating in 1995 that \u2018Although I had painted most of my life, it was through my contact with Bomberg that I felt I might actually function as a painter. Coming to Bomberg\u2019s class was like coming home\u2019 (quoted in Paul Moorhouse, Leon Kossoff, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1996, p.12).\r\n\r\nKossoff made several self-portraits during his career, as well as paintings of other sitters, and was himself painted by his close friend and contemporary, the British painter Frank Auerbach (see Portrait of Leon Kossoff 1951, Tate L02669). Auerbach and Kossoff first met in the Antique Room at St Martin\u2019s in 1948 and became lifelong friends and colleagues. They moved on to study together at London\u2019s Royal College of Art and continued to work closely, observing London street scenes, studying paintings at the National Gallery and becoming associated with the loosely defined group of artists known as the School of London. Auerbach\u2019s Portrait of Leon Kossoff has a similar composition to Self-Portrait in the way that it enlarges and focuses on Kossoff\u2019s head, and was painted from life around the time that the two artists were attending Bomberg\u2019s classes. The brushwork in both paintings is indicative of the young artists\u2019 developing expressionist style, including the sculptural layering of loaded brushstrokes. Furthermore, the close-up composition that excludes contextual detail in Self-Portrait and is seen in Kossoff\u2019s work more generally has led critic and curator Poul Eric T\u00f8jner to comment that the world shown in Kossoff\u2019s canvases \u2018is wrenched free of its origin and quite simply becomes the universe. There is nothing outside. There is nothing behind, before or after \u2026 Kossoff\u2019s work insists on its own time and its own space.\u2019 (T\u00f8jner in Juul and Kold (eds.) 2004, p.5.)"}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 20, "fields": {"artist": 4, "title": "Willesden Junction", "ymade": 1971, "medium": "Oil on board", "descr": "This work is a large rectangular oil painting by the British artist Leon Kossoff depicting a semi-abstract, elevated view of an area of north-west London. The scene is mostly rendered in thick lines and patches of yellow, blue, grey, white and orange-brown paint. In the painting\u2019s foreground, metal structures are shown suspending a set of electrical wires above a railway track, and the track itself can be seen receding into the distance, giving the painting a sense of depth. In the background is a clouded sky, a horizon made up of buildings and trees and, to the left, a large bright yellow building with what appear to be chimneys rising from its top. The abstract style of this scene and its dark palette make it difficult to identify individual forms among the painting\u2019s mass of lines, although the scene becomes more easily decipherable when the viewer stands a short distance away from the painting.\r\n\r\nKossoff made this work in 1971 in his Willesden Green studio, which he had occupied since 1968 and which was located a short distance from the part of London depicted in the painting. Before applying paint to the board, Kossoff drew the scene multiple times from life and in his studio, both on paper and on the board itself. This practice stemmed from Kossoff\u2019s belief that drawing was an essential part of the process of painting. He stated in 1986 that \u2018drawing is a springing to life in the presence of the friend in the studio or in the sunlit summer streets of London \u2026 painting is a deepening of this process\u2019 (quoted in Annely Juda Fine Art 2013, p.18).\r\n\r\nAs the title of this painting suggests, the train tracks that are shown in the work are those of Willesden Junction railway station. Kossoff had lived in Willesden Junction from 1963 to 1968, only moving to Willesden Green when his studio flooded, and he made many paintings of the station during this time and throughout the 1970s, when this work was produced (see, for example, Willesden Junction, Summer 1966 1966, Alfred East Art Gallery, Kettering). He worked on each one sporadically, often exploring a possible view of the Junction for several years before he began to make the final painting. In 1996 he described this process:\r\n\r\nThe paint is mixed before starting \u2013 there is always more than one board around to start another version. The process goes on a long time, sometimes a year or two. Though other things are happening in my life which affect me, the image that I might leave appears moments after scraping, as a response to a slight change of movement or light.\r\n(Quoted in Leon Kossoff from the Early Years, exhibition catalogue, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, New York 2009, p.7.)\r\nIn a 2013 interview with the art critic Charlotte Higgins, Kossoff observed that \u2018something happens when you see Willesden Junction stretching out in front of you. What else can you do but draw it?\u2019 (quoted in Higgins 2013, accessed 4 December 2014). In this same interview Higgins argued that the continued appeal of Kossoff\u2019s Willesden Junction works is connected to the fact that although they are \u2018the kind of landscapes that many people would hesitate to regard as \u201cscenic\u201d\u2019, they nonetheless \u2018carry their own rough loveliness\u2019 (Higgins 2013, accessed 4 December 2014).\r\n\r\nKossoff is well known for his paintings and drawings that depict scenes of his native London, and this work is typical of the expressionist style that has earned the artist increasing renown since the mid-1950s. Kossoff is part of the influential School of London, a group of painters working in London during the 1960s and 1970s that included R.B. Kitaj, Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach and Francis Bacon. Although only loosely considered an art historical movement, the School of London explored new approaches to figurative drawing and painting at a time when art had become dominated by minimalism and conceptualism."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 21, "fields": {"artist": 4, "title": "Two Seated Figures", "ymade": 1980, "medium": "Oil paint on board", "descr": "This painting is a unique departure from Kossoff's usual methods.

From the original panel, Lichtenstein produced preliminary drawings, one of which is in Tate\u2019s collection (Drawing for \u2018Whaam!\u2019 1963, Tate T01131). In this drawing, he set out his first visualisation of the painting, including marking the divide of the original single panel into two parts, confining the main plane to one and the explosion to the other. Revealing Lichtenstein\u2019s process of making minor changes during a work\u2019s creation, the colour annotations on the drawing are different to the final colours used in the painting, notably the use of yellow instead of white for the letters of \u2018WHAAM!\u2019. To make the final painting, Lichtenstein projected the preparatory study onto the two pre-primed canvases and drew around the projection in pencil before applying the Ben-Day dots. This involved using a homemade aluminium mesh and pushing oil paint through the holes with a small scrubbing brush. Onto this he painted the thick outlines of shapes and areas of solid colour in Magna acrylic resin paint. This use of different materials has made cleaning the painting a particular challenge for conservators (see \u2018Conserving Whaam!\u2019, Tate website, 1 March 2018, https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lichtenstein-whaam-t00897/conserving-whaam, accessed 7 November 2018). According to the artist, the diptych took one month to produce from start to finish (Lichtenstein, letter to Richard Morphet, 10 July 1967, Tate Catalogue file).\r\n\r\nWhile Lichtenstein\u2019s work that draws on popular imagery from advertising and cartoons involves a degree of appropriation, the artist himself acknowledged that the act is really one of transformation: \u2018I am nominally copying, but I am really restating the copied thing in other terms. In doing that, the original acquires a totally different texture.\u2019 (Quoted in Lawrence Alloway, Roy Lichtenstein, New York 1983, p.106.) By taking the comic strip and using it as he does, he conflates the powerful but so-called \u2018low\u2019 mass-produced commercial image with the traditionally venerated medium of large-scale easel painting. Lichtenstein also explained the significance of the military subject matter he chose for many of his paintings during 1962\u20133: \u2018At that time I was interested in anything I could use as a subject that was emotionally strong \u2013 usually love, war, or something that was highly-charged and emotional subject matter. Also, I wanted the subject matter to be opposite to the removed and deliberate painting techniques.\u2019 (Lichtenstein in John Coplans, \u2018Interview with Roy Lichtenstein\u2019, Artforum, May 1967, p.36.) He saw the style of cartoons, with their easily digestible lines and primary colours, as an appropriate vehicle for painting a dramatic scene in a detached, calculated manner.\r\n\r\nThe choice of cartoon to represent military action arguably also renders the scene ridiculous and juvenile. Although the intention of the original publication of the comic may have been to show glorious, action-filled images of \u2018All-American Men of War\u2019, through Lichtenstein\u2019s quasi-absurdist treatment, the scene is turned into what art critic Alastair Sooke has described as \u2018a tongue-in-cheek male daydream of aggression, conquest and ejaculatory release\u2019 (Alastair Sooke, Roy Lichtenstein: How Modern Art Was Saved by Donald Duck, London 2013, p.2). Considering Whaam! was created in 1963, just as the Vietnam War was gathering steam, and taking into account Lichtenstein\u2019s own service in the US Army in 1943\u20136, this deconstruction of military heroism could be read as a statement on the folly of war. Lichtenstein explored the imagery of explosion in two other works in Tate\u2019s collection, Wall Explosion II 1965 (Tate T03083) and Explosion 1965\u20136 (Tate P01796).\r\n\r\nThe content, conceptual basis and production of Whaam! makes the viewing of the work full of contradictory dualities which are never fully resolved \u2013 highly charged subject matter rendered in a dispassionate, detached style; commercial art in a fine art context; the mass-produced image painstakingly rendered by hand in a unique painting; the familiarity of the imagery and its alien application in scale and medium. Many of these dualities chime with ideas explored in the wider pop art movement by the likes of Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 24, "fields": {"artist": 5, "title": "Interior with Waterlilies", "ymade": 1991, "medium": "Oil paint and acrylic paint on canvas", "descr": "This work is one of a series of paintings Lichtenstein made in the early 1990s depicting domestic interiors. Painted on a very large scale, they were inspired by a billboard advertisement for a furniture store Lichtenstein had seen outside Rome in 1989. Lichtenstein, a leading figure of American Pop art, is best known for his 1960s paintings derived from comic strip panels, such as Whaam! 1963 (Tate T00897). Throughout his career he continued to base his paintings on imagery from popular culture and the mass media. He sourced the images for this painting, as for others in his Interiors series, from advertisements found in the Yellow Pages.\r\n\r\nIn the US, Pop artists reacted against the Abstract Expressionism and post-painterly abstraction that prevailed in the art of the 1950s by incorporating imagery appropriated from popular culture and features of design into their work in an attempt to introduce aspects of life into art. In Interior with Waterlilies, Lichtenstein continues this Pop tradition, exploiting both commercial techniques and imagery. Blown-up to this monumental scale, the stripes and Benday dots \u2013 used to represent colour and tone in the print technology of the source material \u2013 become conspicuous features of the design in their own right. Whereas earlier works were drawn directly on the canvas from smaller sketches, in this series Lichtenstein made use of a projector to enlarge the design to the appropriate size. His characteristic use of paper stencils, used to mask off areas of the canvas to be left blank, is evident in the sharp raised edges of the painted shapes.\r\n\r\nAs in much of Lichtenstein\u2019s work, there is a sense of detachment to the painting; the bedroom furniture represented here is generic, the colours are bland pastels, and the rendering flat, unreal and illustrational. But offering only a minimum of information, Lichtenstein gives enough detail for the viewer to complete the picture, for the work to become a believable representation. The vast scale of this painting and the strong perspective of the bed \u2013 painted roughly life-size, with its corner seeming to jut out into the gallery space \u2013 almost invites the viewer into the work. There are personal references within the composition too. The paintings depicted on the walls in this image represent Lichtenstein\u2019s own works, some of which themselves make reference to the works of other artists. This self-referentiality is a constant in Lichtenstein\u2019s work throughout his career, where much of his art quotes or comments on earlier aspects of his work. His interior paintings themselves refer back to the domestic interiors in his paintings of the early 60s. The picture above the dresser on the left of the composition is from Lichtenstein\u2019s Waterlilies series of the early 1990s, based on iconic works by Claude Monet (1840-1926). This feature provides the title for this painting."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 25, "fields": {"artist": 5, "title": "Two Nudes", "ymade": 1994, "medium": "Relief print on paper", "descr": "Two Nudes 1994 is one of a series of nine screenprints that Lichtenstein produced in 1994 on the subject of the nude. Other examples from the series in Tate\u2019s collection are Roommates 1994 (Tate AL00376) and Nude Reading 1994 (Tate AL00375). The prints were made at Tyler Graphics Ltd., Mount Kisco, New York and are recorded in the second volume of the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints (Corlett and Fine 2002). As well as using hand-cut stencils to produce his trademark Benday dots in irregularly shaped pieces, Lichtenstein employed computer-generated dye-cut stencils, produced by Swan Engraving, for some of the areas of dots and patterns in these prints. This copy of Two Nudes is number one of twelve artist\u2019s proofs aside from the edition of forty.\r\n\r\nIn the final years of his life, Lichtenstein took up the theme of the nude \u2013 one of the major subjects in the history of visual art \u2013 and it became an important part of his late work. As well as series of prints, Lichtenstein made paintings on the subject of the nude, including works such as Nudes with Beach Ball 1994 and Blue Nude 1994. It was the first time that he had approached the subject, but also marked a return to the comic book style of imagery he had first developed in the early 1960s. Rather than working from life, Lichtenstein drew on female figures from the comic books he had first used in the 1960s, removed their clothes and imagined their bare bodies beneath in order to recreate them as nudes. Reproduced as comic-strip heroines, the figures in these works are intentionally provocative, presented to the viewer as a generic object of desire.\r\n\r\nThe nudes also show Lichtenstein developing compositional techniques. Speaking in an interview in 1994, he noted that he explored the subject of the nude because it was \u2018a good excuse to contrast undulating and volumetric form with rigid geometry\u2019 (quoted in Robert Hurlburt, \u2018Lichtenstein Returns to Comic-Book Style\u2019, Sun-Sentinel, Fort Lauderdale, 13 November 1994, cited in Christie\u2019s, New York, Prints & Multiples, auction catalogue, Sale 2548, 24\u20135 April 2012). Curator Sheena Wagstaff has explained:\r\n\r\nIn the Nudes, not only did Lichtenstein alter the equation in the compositional tension between motif and formal concerns, but also, crucially, he seized upon a new pictorial language. He deduced and acknowledged the nude as a form through which a new syntax could emerge by means of an understated narrative that implies a relationship between the artist-creator and the nude.\r\n(Sheena Wagstaff, \u2018Late Nudes\u2019, in Rondeau and Wagstaff 2012, p.95.)\r\nThe nudes relate to many other areas of Lichtenstein\u2019s output, including reflections, mirrors and interiors, and they demonstrate his ongoing fascination with the modern masters, particularly Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. He explained:\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve always been interested in Matisse but maybe a little more interested in Picasso. But they are both overwhelming influences on everyone, really. Whether one tries to be like them or tries not to be like them, they\u2019re always there as presences to be dealt with. They\u2019re just too formidable to have no interest. I think that somebody who pretends he\u2019s not interested is not interested in art.\r\n(Roy Lichtenstein, \u2018A Review of My Work Since 1961\u2019, in Bader 2009., p.55.)"}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 26, "fields": {"artist": 5, "title": "Reflections on Girl", "ymade": 1990, "medium": "Lithograph, screenprint on paper and metalised PVC on paper", "descr": "Reflections on Girl 1990 is from a group of seven Reflections prints which Lichtenstein worked on at Tyler Graphics in Mount Kisco, New York during 1989 and 1990.

Swan Engraving, Bridgeport, Connecticut, processed the magnesium plates.\u2019 (Corlett 1994, pp.221\u20136). Tate\u2019s copies are part of the sixteen artist\u2019s proofs aside from the edition of sixty-eight. The other prints in the series are: Reflections on Hair 1990 (Tate P12127), Reflections on Brushstrokes 1990 (Tate P12128), Reflections on Crash 1990 (Tate AL00368), Reflections on Conversation 1990 (Tate AL00367), Reflections on Minerva 1990 (Tate AL00370) and Reflections on The Scream 1990 (Tate AL00371). In all the Reflection prints, the image is partly obscured by semi-abstract blocks of colour and pattern which simulate reflected light, as if the image is seen behind glass or reflected in another surface. The idea was developed by Lichtenstein in a group of paintings he started in 1988 and which he continued to work on until 1993. Speaking of the paintings series in 1995, the artist explained:\r\n\r\nIt started when I tried to photograph a print by Robert Rauschenberg that was under glass. But the light from a window reflected on the surface of the glass and prevented me from taking a good picture. But it gave me the idea of photographing fairly well-known works under glass, where the reflection would hide most of the work, but you could still make out what the subject was. Well, I tried to do a few photographs in this manner; but I am not much of a photographer. Later the idea occurred to me to do the same idea in painting; and I started this series on various early works of mine \u2026 It portrays a painting under glass. It is framed and the glass is preventing you from seeing the painting. Of course the reflections are just an excuse to make an abstract work, with the cartoon image being supposedly partly hidden by the reflections.\r\n(Roy Lichtenstein, \u2018A Review of My Work Since 1961\u2019, in Bader 2009, p.69.)\r\nIn making the screenprints in the Reflections series, Lichtenstein appropriated imagery from his past works, and particularly from comic book sources, returning to subject matter he had addressed in the 1960s. Lichtenstein\u2019s approach in these reflection works can therefore be read as a witty comment on the techniques of pop artists who themselves quoted and reused imagery found in popular culture, and perhaps an acknowledgement that his own work had entered into popularised visual culture. The idea of reflection in these works also has a precedent in earlier works by Lichtenstein in which mirrors and reflections on glass play a key part, for example, in works derived from comic strips such as In the Car 1963 (Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, GMA 2133).\r\n\r\nLichtenstein was born in New York, and was a central player in American pop art. He came to prominence in the 1960s, making works based on imagery from comic strips, such as In the Car and Whaam! 1963 (Tate T00897). In these works he used the Benday dot, common to newspaper and magazine reproduction, to produce works that appeared mechanically reproduced, and which in fact are even more stylised than the cartoons Lichtenstein appropriated.

This print is from a portfolio entitled 'X + X(Ten Works by Ten Painters)' which was produced in an edition of 500 prints in 1964. Printed on plastic, this is one of Lichtenstein's first Pop prints, and the first to be made on a surface other than paper.

One arm is suspended from this upright by a looped \u2018S\u2019 of metal, typical of Calder\u2019s elegant forms. The red disc at the end of this first arm provides the counter-weight for the second arm, which balances organic green and yellow forms. With an elegance born out of the necessity to establish these balances, Calder used progressively thinner grades of rod for the legs and arms.

It features a bold, abstract image of the sun and its emanating rays of light, all rendered in a deep black tone. A ball at the top right corner of the composition signifies the body of the sun, from which large black zig-zags extend, starting with narrow points near the sun and broadening out to thick mid-sections in the lower-middle of the paper before tailing off in faint brushstrokes in the left of the work. There is another black circle beneath the sun, positioned between two of the zig-zagged light rays, and a thick hollow triangle hovers in the white space below it.\r\n\r\nThis work was created by the American artist Alexander Calder in 1953. To make it Calder applied two to three layers of black gouache on top of one other using a brush, resulting in a slightly shiny appearance. The artist made the work in sun-drenched Aix-en-Provence in southern France, where Calder and his family spent much of the summer of 1953. It is one of a large number of gouaches that he created between June and September of that year and is among the first group of large-scale works that the artist made outdoors (see Alley 1981, p.93; and Calder Foundation, undated, accessed 26 January 2017). Aix had been the home of French post-impressionist painter Paul C\u00e9zanne and of Calder\u2019s great friend, the surrealist artist Andr\u00e9 Masson. Both painted the local landscape obsessively, and although Calder did not produce landscapes, Black Sun may have been a response to the intense heat and light in the region.\r\n\r\nCalder\u2019s mobile sculpture Antennae with Red and Blue Dots c.1953 (Tate T00541) was made at a similar time to this work and also features solid black forms that distend in the middle and radiate from small circles \u2013 in the sculpture\u2019s case the circles are yellow, white, blue and red. The shape of this suspended sculpture resembles an orrery \u2013 a mechanical model of the solar system \u2013 and taken together the two works suggest Calder\u2019s interest in the heliotropic movement of the solar system.\r\n\r\nThe artist favoured astronomical motifs throughout his career and Black Sun is recalled in Calder\u2019s paintings as well as his sculptures: for instance, in the thunderous waves emanating from a yellow and red sphere in Lightning 1955 and in the small black circle surrounded by sinuous rays in Santos 1956 (both Calder Foundation, New York). In 1962 Calder repeated the black sun motif in the tapestry Black Head (artist\u2019s collection), made for his wife Louisa Calder.\r\n\r\nAlthough Calder often worked with planes of pure black, they were commonly augmented with dashes of primary colour (see, for instance, Mobile c.1932, Tate L01686). The purely monochrome nature of Black Sun not only runs counter to this trend, but also to the common association of the sun with light and colour. This indicates that the artist may have been thinking about the effect of shadow created by the large-scale outdoor mobiles he was making in the hot, bright climate of southern France."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 32, "fields": {"artist": 6, "title": "Antennae with Red and Blue Dots", "ymade": 1953, "medium": "Aluminium and steel wire", "descr": "Alexander Calder\u2019s Antennae with Red and Blue Dots c.1953 is a hanging sculpture that extends just over a metre in each direction and is designed to be displayed suspended from its upper steel wire.

Although Calder\u2019s mobile sculptures are not inert and their motion does not follow a set pattern of movement, there are specific rules for connecting the elements. The Calder Foundation provided the following instructions for Antennae with Red and Blue Dots: \u2018the smallest black elements should hang as far from the largest black elements as possible, not directly beneath them\u2019. (Armin\u00e9e Chahbazian, Calder Foundation, letter to Tate curator Michela Parkin, 12 June 1995, Tate Acquisition File, Alexander Calder.)\r\n\r\nAfter training as a mechanical engineer, Calder began to make animated animals and people in wood and wire in 1926, creating works such as the circus that he named Cirque Calder 1926\u201331 (Whitney Museum of American Art, New York). Living in Paris in 1931, he joined the group Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation and started making sculptures which could be moved by hand or by small electric motors. He then started to make the forms for which he is best known, namely his mobiles \u2013 suspended networks of wires and painted forms that could be set in motion by air currents. Mobile c.1932 (Tate L01686) is an earlier construction that contains several of the same fin-like forms and primary colours that are seen in Antennae with Red and Blue Dots.\r\n\r\nWhen hung, Antennae with Red and Blue Dots experiences constant shifts in position and might not always resemble static photographs of it fully extended. This was part of Calder\u2019s intention for his sculptures, and in 1932 he wrote:\r\n\r\nEach element able to move, to stir, to oscillate, to come and go in its relationships with the other elements in its universe. It must not be just a fleeting \u2018moment\u2019, but a physical bond between the varying elements in life.\r\n(Quoted in Borchardt-Hume 2015, p.219.)\r\nCurator Penelope Curtis noted the performative elements of Calder\u2019s sculpture in relation to the title of his retrospective Alexander Calder: Performing Sculpture at Tate Modern, London, in 2015:\r\n\r\n\u2018Performing Sculpture\u2019 clearly has a double sense and perhaps both meanings can be applied to the work of Alexander Calder. On the one hand it is a category of sculpture that performs; on the other it is a state of being, an act of transformation, a moment in which the sculpture become sculptural.\r\n(Penelope Curtis, \u2018Performance or Post-Performance\u2019, in Borchardt-Hume 2015, p.14.)\r\nCalder\u2019s works invite dynamic interaction between artwork and viewer, performing sculpture through an investigation of space and motion."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 33, "fields": {"artist": 6, "title": "T and Swallow", "ymade": 1936, "medium": "Wood and steel", "descr": "Long concerned with movement, the American sculptor Alexander Calder invented what Marcel Duchamp named the \u2018mobile\u2019.

It depicts a flat, open landscape in which four foreground figures are frozen as they respond to a sudden gust of wind. It is based on a woodcut, Travellers Caught in a Sudden breeze at Ejiri (c.1832) from a famous portfolio, The Thirty-six Views of Fuji, by the Japanese painter and printmaker Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849). Wall photographed actors in a landscape located outside his home town, Vancouver, at times when similar weather conditions prevailed over a period of five months. He then collaged elements of the photograph digitally in order to achieve the desired composition. The result is a tableau which appears staged in the manner of a classical painting. As in Hokusai\u2019s original, two men clutch their hats to their heads while a third stares up into the sky, where his trilby is being carried away by the wind. On the left, a woman\u2019s body is halted in a state of shock, her head concealed by her scarf which has been blown around her face. A sheaf of papers in her hand has been dispersed by the gust and their trajectory, over the centre of the image, creates a sense of dynamic movement. Two narrow trees, also in the foreground, bend in the force of the wind, releasing dead leaves which mingle with the floating papers. In Hokusai\u2019s image the landscape is a curving path through a reed-filled area next to a lake, leading towards Mount Fuji in the far distance. In Wall\u2019s version, flat brown fields abut onto a canal. Small shacks, a row of telegraph poles and concrete pillars and piping evoke industrial farming. The unromantic nature of the landscape is reinforced by a small structure made of corrugated iron in the foreground. The pathway on which the figures stand is a dirt track extending along the front of the photograph from one side to the other. There is no sense of connection between the characters, whose position in the landscape appears incongruous. Two wear smart city clothes, adding to the sense of displacement."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 35, "fields": {"artist": 7, "title": "A View from an Apartment", "ymade": 2004, "medium": "Transparency on lightbox", "descr": "A View from an Apartment is a colour photograph displayed as a transparency in a lightbox that measures almost two and a half metres in length and over a metre and a half in height. It shows a domestic interior with two casually dressed female occupants. The space, decorated in muted colours, is comfortably and conventionally furnished as a sitting room with sofa, chairs and tables. An ironing board, a television set, vases of flowers, piles of magazines and a half-consumed pot of tea are amongst the paraphernalia of everyday life contained within it. One of the women, apparently caught in the midst of household chores, walks from the ironing board towards a laundry basket. Her companion slumps on the sofa reading a magazine. However, the room is dominated by the large, rectangular window behind them and the exterior scene beyond that. This combination of inside and outside produces two pictorial worlds in one image.\r\n\r\nThe view framed by the large window seems to be the one to which the work\u2019s title calls attention. It offers a panorama of the port of Vancouver, the city in which Wall lives and works, and shows multi-windowed low rise buildings, a stretch of waterway and a row of industrial cranes which appear like a vivid red armature partially obscuring the tall buildings of the city\u2019s skyline in the far distance. Whilst the minute detail of the enclosed space contrasts with the vast urban scene beyond it, pronounced vertical and horizontal lines created inside are echoed in the network of lines that make up the scene outside.\r\n\r\nWall\u2019s output prior to A View from an Apartment includes a number of images of interiors, of which some, such as Jell-0 1995 and Volunteer 1996, have domestic subjects (reproduced in Jeff Wall: The Complete Edition, London 2009, pp.60\u20131 and pp.102\u20133, respectively). \u2018View from an Apartment began ... by the recognition that most of the interiors I\u2019ve photographed are quite closed in\u2019, the artist has said. \u2018I don\u2019t like to repeat myself and so I wanted to do an interior that was open, that included an outside.\u2019 (Quoted in Wagstaff, p.43.) Having selected the location, Wall asked one of the models to furnish the apartment and to live in it as if it were her own. The scene was photographed between May 2004 and March 2005 and the resulting images were then combined. The finished work\u2019s clarity and the consistency of light levels in the interior and exterior portions of the composition were achieved by digitally enhancing the image during the post-production process.\r\n\r\nA View from an Apartment demonstrates Wall\u2019s meticulous attention to detail and his preoccupation with endowing apparently everyday subjects with a sense of the cinematographic. His arrangement of colours, textures and patterns \u2013 in which frames predominate \u2013 emphasises the pictorial structure of the image. The resulting scene suggests a narrative captured midway through. Wall has commented:\r\n\r\nWhen you\u2019re looking at a picture you are feeling that you are really seeing something, seeing it in a way you can\u2019t see it in the world itself ... [B]ut it is more interesting to depict something in a way that the viewer feels he or she is really seeing, but at the same time suggest that something significant isn\u2019t being seen \u2013 that the act of picturing creates an unseen as well as a seen."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 36, "fields": {"artist": 7, "title": "Diagonal Composition", "ymade": 1993, "medium": "Transparency on lightbox", "descr": "Diagonal Composition is a colour photograph of the detail of an interior. Like the majority of Wall\u2019s images, it is displayed in a light box. It represents a balanced composition of dynamically intersecting and crossing parallel and diagonal lines, the result of viewing and framing the subject from a particular angle. Part of an enamel sink in the foreground is surrounded by a yellow formica surface, the lines of which are sharply defined by metal edging running parallel to the sides of the sink. The intersection of the metal strips at the rear corner of the sink is slightly to the left of the centre of the photograph. They frame a bar of soap and lump of white detritus lying on the formica next to the sink. To the right, a small dark shelf extends into the upper right side of the image, its rounded corner echoing the rounded corner of the sink in the foreground directly below it. Behind the shelf, a strip of light blue formica is nailed to the white wooden planks on the wall. White concrete below the shelf is brightly lit, revealing the trace of a cobweb hanging from the shelf\u2019s metal trim. A vertical shadow on the right side of the photograph echoes the shadow inside the sink. Above the brown formica panel behind the sink is a plank of wood, its grain running at right angles to the printed grain of the formica. It is parallel to the metal strip at the back of the sink, the blue formica at the back of the shelf and the narrow dark margin at the upper edge of the white concrete. A piece of coarsely woven fabric draped over the wood disappears out of the picture frame and then reappears, hanging directly above the soap. The surfaces between the diagonal lines of the composition are discoloured with age and use. Splashes and smears of white, rust stains and two circular imprints left by objects standing on the shelf for a long time have a painterly quality. The photograph was taken in Wall\u2019s basement studio. It is life sized.\r\n\r\nDiagonal Composition is one of a small number of works Wall has produced which focus on empty interiors with still-life resonances. Wall was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada and trained initially as a painter at the University of British Colombia. After completing an MA in 1970, he moved to London to undertake doctoral research in art history at the Courtauld Institute (completed 1973). Dissatisfied with established artistic forms, he was searching for his own medium. He explained:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat interested me ... was to make pictures that had specific relationships with certain kinds of painting ... certain kinds of cinema ... and certain kinds of photography ... and to find a way of hybridising all that I admired about all those things ... I thought, for my purposes, that painting needed to be more psychologically intense, cinema needed to be \u2018arrested\u2019 (according to the concepts from Barthes and Benjamin), and photography needed to be made more viable at the scale of the human body, the scale of natural vision, a scale that painting had mastered.\r\n\r\n(Quoted in Matthew Barney, Tony Oursler, Jeff Wall, exhibition catalogue, Sammlung Goetz, Munich 1996, p.89.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1977, on a coach journey from Barcelona to London, Wall was struck by something he had seen many times before without remarking. A back-lit bus stop advertisement triggered the solution for combining the elements described above. The large-scale back-lit photographic transparency became Wall\u2019s signature medium. Unlike a painting which reflects light, the light box emanates light, filtering it through the photographic image. In common with film, the image relies on a space which is hidden. For Wall, this inaccessible space is a source of disassociation, alienation and power (Barents, p.99). Referring to his images as \u2018pictorial typologies\u2019, he has commented that his aim is \u2018to represent both the surface of damaged life, and its opposite, the possibility of another life, one which will come out of this one as its negation\u2019 (quoted in Barents, p.102). Staged in the manner of classical paintings, Wall\u2019s photographs subvert the celebratory and idealising politics traditional to that genre. Characters in his works of the 1980s represent, and subtly comment on the plight of, ethnic minorities, the working class poor and other traditionally abject aspects of society. Where he represents landscapes, Wall selects locations in which nature is impinged upon by suburbia or industrialisation. In Diagonal Composition, such details as the cracked and dirty bar of soap and the lump of unidentifiable crumpled white detritus recall the page of Involuntary Sculptures \u2013 close-up photographs of small fragments of everyday life - by Gyula Brassa\u00ef (1899-1984) and Salvador Dali (1904-89) which were published in the Surrealist magazine Minotaure in 1933. With its worn and soiled surfaces, Diagonal Composition presents an ordinary, although usually disregarded, corner of life as a harmonious and beautiful whole.\r\n\r\nDiagonal Composition was produced in an edition of ten, of which this is the seventh."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 37, "fields": {"artist": 8, "title": "Shoes", "ymade": 1985, "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "descr": "In all her object paintings, Milroy presents things in their most characteristic profile, side on or from above, depending on the objects concerned.

Milroy has framed the image to emphasise the building\u2019s symmetrical structure. Only a section of the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade is depicted. It is cropped as though viewed through a camera\u2019s lens in a composition based on horizontal and vertical lines. A narrow strip of tarmac edged by a single yellow line runs along the bottom of the painting. Above it and parallel, the pavement is contained within a horizontal strip. Horizontal parallels continue up the painting, following the base of the building and the grid of its regularly spaced rectangular windows. The windows extend four storeys in height and nine in width. At the bottom centre of the image, the building\u2019s entrance consists of dark doors flanked by an imposing pair of columns above three steps. At ground floor level the windows are blank white as though covered by blinds. The windows at the level of the first floor bear a row of decorative metal tracery at their base. It is both ornamental and protective, echoing the metal railings at the foot of the building. Dark vertical bars painted over the door suggest impenetrability. This sense is heightened by the folds of curtains half visible behind the glass of windows on the first, second and third floors. On the first floor these vertical lines combine with the geometric reflections of buildings in the square, which are visible all along this line of windows. The windows of the two upper floors reflect the sky. The patterning of the pale beige stone work covering the fa\u00e7ade is neatly detailed. It is stylised and diagrammatic in appearance. At the same time, perspectival distance indicated by the gaps between the stones on the pavement and the contour of the railings as they join with a section of low wall on either side of the entrance confers a sense of three dimensional space.\r\n\r\nFinsbury Square belongs to a series of Travel Paintings Milroy created between 1993 and 1995. The result of recent trips abroad, the paintings depict street scenes in Tokyo, Kyoto, Rome and London. A single interior, Vancouver Living Room 1994 (private collection, Italy), is also part of the series. Milroy was born and raised in Vancouver and came to London, to attend a foundation course at St Martin\u2019s School of Art, in 1979. Based in London since that date, she became known in the mid 1980s for paintings of objects arranged in grids. Initially the objects were completely contained within the picture frame. In such paintings as Shoes 1985 (Tate T06532), the image of a pair of ordinary black court shoes, arranged in differing configurations and viewed from above, is repeated neatly in rows over the canvas. Later, in such paintings as Light Bulbs 1988 (Tate T05217), clusters of different kinds of light bulbs extend to be cropped by the painting\u2019s edge, approximating the plane of canvas with that of a photograph or other form of printed reproduction. The objects in these paintings are painted realistically enough to be easily recognised, yet loosely enough to draw attention to the materiality of the paint and the artist\u2019s brushstrokes. The objects cast shadows on the neutral white ground against which they are represented but, without visual hierarchy, become a form of patterning over the surface of the canvas reminiscent of wallpaper. Between figuration and abstraction, the paintings offer simply representation, what the artist has called \u2018giving space to looking\u2019 (quoted in Lisa Milroy, p.17). Milroy\u2019s paintings share common ground with the drawings of household objects by Michael Craig-Martin (born 1941), who taught her on the BA course at Goldsmith\u2019s College, London (attended 1979-82). Like such works by Craig-Martin as Reading with Globe 1980 (T03102), Milroy\u2019s paintings may be read as an exploration of the basic language of visual representation.\r\n\r\nIn Milroy\u2019s Travel Paintings, scenes resembling tourist snapshots in Tokyo are painted with the hybrid style referred to above, in which the act of painting is a means to reflect on painting as representation. Buildings and street scenes in Rome were painted in the same manner. By contrast, the series of four houses and one warehouse in Kyoto, like the four buildings in London to which Finsbury Square belongs, consist of flat areas of colour in which brush strokes are barely visible. While the Kyoto buildings are softened by undulating tiles on the roofs and the occasional plant, the grid-lines of the modernist architecture portrayed in the London buildings emphasises their graphic qualities. Entirely emptied of human and vehicular presence, they have a blank, eery quality. In Finsbury Square this is redeemed by reflections of sky and other buildings in the windows which open up the imaginary space of the painting to a vast arena behind and beyond the viewer."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 40, "fields": {"artist": 8, "title": "Room", "ymade": 1997, "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "descr": "Room 1997 is a very large landscape-orientated painting, almost square in its dimensions, depicting a traditional Japanese interior. The work takes a frontal perspective on the space, which is decorated in muted colours and furnished in an orderly, minimalist style. On the left side of the room are translucent gridded windows that extend almost from the floor to the ceiling, while the right side consists of a white sliding door that is open, revealing a glimpse of an empty space beyond, with smaller closed white doors above it. The far end of the room is divided by intersecting wooden beams set against a sea green wall that features a grey wall hanging displaying a gridded pattern. Below and to the left of the wall hanging stands a small vase that is perched on a thin ledge and contains flowers with curving stems \u2013 the only non-geometric element in the composition. Also at the back of the room are additional white cupboards, with one set positioned above an inverted wall section housing recessed windows. The ceiling of the room is wooden, and the floor is empty and covered in finely woven green rectangular mats arranged in a neat formation. The work is precisely rendered, with the paint evenly applied in thin layers that produce a very smooth surface.\r\n\r\nThis work was made by the British-Canadian artist Lisa Milroy in London, where she has lived and worked since 1978. She moved to the city that year to study first at Saint Martin\u2019s School of Art and then at Goldsmith\u2019s College, from which she graduated in 1982 and where her tutors included the British painters Michael Craig-Martin and Basil Beattie.\r\n\r\nRoom can be seen in the context of the artist\u2019s long-standing engagement with Japanese culture. While Milroy initially created paintings featuring reproductions of Japanese prints in 1986, her interest in Japan grew more pronounced following the first of many visits to the country in 1989. In 1993 she made a series of small paintings featuring shops, advertisements and consumer goods in Tokyo that stemmed from a three-month residency in the city, and in 1994 she completed a series of larger canvases based on buildings in Kyoto. Other paintings she made in the 1990s featured Japanese kimonos and sweets, and in the subsequent decade geisha became a prominent subject for Milroy, with this traditional Japanese female figure appearing in works such as the four-panelled Painting Fast Painting Slow 2004. In a 2005 interview with the curator Lewis Biggs, Milroy said:\r\n\r\nJapan is certainly the most visually engaging place I\u2019ve ever been to, and the most foreign. Perhaps it\u2019s this combination \u2013 the pleasure in being drawn in through what I see and the alienation of being shut out through not understanding the language or social customs \u2013 that makes it so compelling.\r\n(Quoted in Alan Cristea Gallery 2005, p.8.)\r\nWith its close attention to the geometries of interior space and the arrangement of domestic furnishings, Room may be compared with the carefully ordered compositions that characterised Milroy\u2019s work throughout the 1980s. Her paintings from this time commonly featured grids, rows and columns of objects, ranging from everyday items such as books and clothes to collections of stamps and butterflies (see, for example, Shoes 1985, Tate T06532, and Light Bulbs 1988, Tate T05217). Room can also be assessed alongside other works the artist created in the mid-1990s, such as Vancouver Living Room 1994 and Finsbury Square 1995 (Tate T07128), that depict architectural interiors and exteriors in a frontal manner and dispassionate style.\r\n\r\nIn 2001 the curator Fiona Bradley assessed how the composition of Room \u2013 a title which seems to be as studiously neutral as the space depicted is orderly and harmonious \u2013 might connect to the ambiguous meanings the painting holds:\r\n\r\nRoom (1997) lines up a series of surfaces, parallel and at right angles to the canvas, and describes them. The room is full of articulated space \u2013 the sliding planes of the cupboards, the horizontals of the shelves, the flatness of the tatami mats on the floor. Every inch of the painting is full of noted detail, very particularly Japanese detail, and yet this is still a painting of an empty room. Empty in fact, and empty in aspiration: we are free to fill it with our own idea of what a Japanese room could be.\r\n(Fiona Bradley, \u2018Lisa Milroy\u2019s Painting\u2019, in Biggs, Bradley and Criqui 2001, p.21.)"}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 41, "fields": {"artist": 8, "title": "Girl with Sunglasses", "ymade": 1998, "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "descr": "Girl with Sunglasses 1998 is a landscape-orientated painting, almost square in its dimensions, depicting a young woman set against a grey background that darkens gradually from the top to the bottom of the painting. The woman is shown from the shoulders upwards in the centre of the composition, and turns slightly to her right as she stares into the distance with a tight-lipped, pensive expression. She has pale skin, with a discernible redness to her cheeks and chin, and straight light-brown shoulder-length hair. Dark sunglasses rest on the top of her head, a daisy-shaped earring can be seen in her right ear, and she wears a flowery patterned top that leaves the upper part of her arms visible. The work is precisely rendered in a realist style almost reminiscent of a photograph, with the paint evenly applied in thin layers that produce a very smooth surface.\r\n\r\nThis work was made by the British-Canadian artist Lisa Milroy in London, where she has lived and worked since 1978. She had moved to the city that year to study first at Saint Martin\u2019s School of Art and then at Goldsmith\u2019s College, from which she graduated in 1982 and where her tutors included the British painters Michael Craig-Martin and Basil Beattie. Girl with Sunglasses is among a small series of works, which also includes Girl 1998 (Tate T07432), that are based on photographs taken by Milroy in the summer of 1997. Reluctant to sit face-to-face with a model, the artist used a telephoto lens to capture people waiting in busy parts of London (see Elisabeth Lebovici, \u2018Patience\u2019, trans. by David Britt, in Waddington Galleries 1998, p.3). In this respect, the works may be seen as confirming the view, outlined by the curator Lewis Biggs in 2001, that Milroy\u2019s paintings are \u2018carefully constructed paintings of images\u2019 (Lewis Biggs, \u2018Lisa Milroy\u2019, in Biggs, Bradley and Criqui 2001, p.11). In addition to its almost photographic quality, Girl with Sunglasses seems to draw further attention to notions of looking and image-making through the inclusion of sunglasses on the woman\u2019s head, to which the title makes reference.\r\n\r\nDepicted without any additional context \u2013 the grey background offering an apparently neutral setting \u2013 and without overt facial expression, the woman depicted in Girl with Sunglasses remains ambiguous. Milroy began painting portraits in 1996, and in 1998 the art historian Elisabeth Lebovici emphasised the uncertain nature of her figures: \u2018They are somebody and they are nobody: their identities, feelings, thoughts, desires, even their images are mysterious\u2019 (Lebovici in Waddington Galleries 1998, p.3). In a 2005 interview with Biggs, Milroy described her approach to painting people as \u2018considering them purely as surfaces to be described\u2019 with the resulting effect that the works \u2018evoke the absence of a person rather than their presence\u2019 (quoted in Alan Cristea Gallery 2005, pp.10\u201311).\r\n\r\nMilroy\u2019s work in the 1980s was characterised by carefully ordered compositions that featured grids, rows and columns of objects, ranging from everyday items such as books and clothes to collections of stamps and butterflies (see, for example, Shoes 1985, Tate T06532, and Light Bulbs 1988, Tate T05217). These were pictured against anonymous white or cream surfaces and such paintings that were usually created in a single day. In the early 1990s the subject matter of Milroy\u2019s paintings expanded to include streets, buildings and landscapes in works that were often created over longer periods of time, and which were heavily influenced by journeys the artist made in Japan, Italy, North America and Africa (see, for example, Lisa Milroy: Travel Paintings, exhibition catalogue, Chisenhale Gallery, London 1995). A more cartoon-like aspect to her painting has emerged from the late 1990s onwards, in works such as the large oil painting Memories 2000, which evoke forms of graphic storytelling.\r\n\r\nGirl with Sunglasses was first displayed as part of Milroy\u2019s solo exhibition at the Waddington Galleries in London in 1998."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 42, "fields": {"artist": 8, "title": "Light Bulbs", "ymade": 1988, "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "descr": "Light Bulbs is a large oil painting by Lisa Milroy of various types of domestic light bulb arranged in neat groupings and pictured with prominent shadows on an anonymous white surface.

These forms may at once be independent designs and playful references to the first letter of Empor, the German title of the painting.\r\n\r\nThe related drawing reveals that the small black circle and the horizontal bars of the central motif, which have the physiognomic character of eye and mouth, were not part of Kandinsky\u2019s original design concept and evolved as he worked on the painting. As he wrote in 1929, the year he painted Upward, \u201cI do not choose form consciously; it chooses itself within me.\u201d\u00b9 The physiognomic character of Upward indicates Kandinsky\u2019s association at the Dessau Bauhaus with fellow Blaue Vier artists Paul Klee and Alexej Jawlensky. Jawlensky showed sixteen abstract heads, a motif that appeared in his work as early as 1918, in an exhibition of the Blaue Vier at the Galerie Ferdinand M\u00f6ller in Berlin in October 1929. Shown during the month when Upward was completed, these paintings offered Kandinsky the model of large, abstract faces composed of geometric planes of non-naturalistic color and accented by bar-shaped features. However, Kandinsky\u2019s working method more closely resembled that of Klee, who began with intuitively chosen forms that gradually suggested counterparts in the natural world, than that of Jawlensky, who began with the model and moved toward abstraction. In particular, the whimsy of the hovering black eye in Upward and the incorporation of a letter as a pictogram with a possible reference to the title of the painting suggest the reverberations of Klee\u2019s art."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 59, "fields": {"artist": 11, "title": "Colored Sticks", "ymade": 1928, "medium": "Varnished tempera on paperboard", "descr": "None"}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 60, "fields": {"artist": 11, "title": "Several Circles", "ymade": 1926, "medium": "Oil on canvas", "descr": "When Kandinsky returned to his native Moscow after the outbreak of World War I, his expressive abstract style underwent changes that reflected the utopian artistic experiments of the Russian avant-garde. The emphasis on geometric forms, promoted by artists such as Kazimir Malevich, Aleksandr Rodchenko, and Liubov Popova in an effort to establish a universal aesthetic language, inspired Kandinsky to expand his own pictorial vocabulary. Although he adopted some aspects of the geometrizing trends of Suprematism and Constructivism\u2014such as overlapping flat planes and clearly delineated shapes\u2014his belief in the expressive content of abstract forms alienated him from the majority of his Russian colleagues, who championed more rational, systematizing principles. This conflict led him to return to Germany in 1921. In the Black Square, executed two years later, epitomizes Kandinsky\u2019s synthesis of Russian avant-garde art and his own lyrical abstraction: the white trapezoid recalls Malevich\u2019s Suprematist paintings, but the dynamic compositional elements, resembling clouds, mountains, sun, and a rainbow, still refer to the landscape.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 Kandinsky joined the faculty of the Weimar Bauhaus, where he discovered a more sympathetic environment in which to pursue his art. Originally premised on a Germanic, expressionistic approach to artmaking, the Bauhaus aesthetic came to reflect Constructivist concerns and styles, which by the mid-1920s had become international in scope. While there, Kandinsky furthered his investigations into the correspondence between colors and forms and their psychological and spiritual effects. In Composition 8, the colorful, interactive geometric forms create a pulsating surface that is alternately dynamic and calm, aggressive and quiet. The importance of circles in this painting prefigures the dominant role they would play in many subsequent works, culminating in his cosmic and harmonious image Several Circles. \u201cThe circle,\u201d claimed Kandinsky, \u201cis the synthesis of the greatest oppositions. It combines the concentric and the eccentric in a single form and in equilibrium. Of the three primary forms, it points most clearly to the fourth dimension.\u201d"}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 61, "fields": {"artist": 11, "title": "Pointed and Round", "ymade": 1925, "medium": "Oil on board", "descr": "None"}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 62, "fields": {"artist": 11, "title": "Bright Unity", "ymade": 1925, "medium": "Oil on board", "descr": "None"}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 63, "fields": {"artist": 11, "title": "Yellow Accompaniment", "ymade": 1924, "medium": "Oil on canvas", "descr": "None"}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 64, "fields": {"artist": 11, "title": "Blue Painting", "ymade": 1924, "medium": "Oil on canvas, mounted on board", "descr": "None"}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 65, "fields": {"artist": 11, "title": "White Cross", "ymade": 1922, "medium": "Oil on canvas", "descr": "Vasily Kandinsky referred to the early 1920s as his \u201ccool period.\u201d From this time geometric shapes became increasingly prevalent in his work, often floating in front of or within a broad plane, as in White Cross. Here straight lines and circles offset looser, organic forms and irregularly geometric shapes. A corresponding variation of brushstroke produces highly active passages contrasting with less inflected areas. Some shapes may have their distant origins in a naturalistic vocabulary of forms. Thus, the fishlike crescent and the lancing black diagonal that crosses it, which appear also in the related Red Oval of 1920 (Collection Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York), may recall the boat with oars in earlier works. However, the motifs are stripped of their representational meaning and do not contribute to an interpretation of the whole in terms of realistic content.  The title isolates a detail of the composition, the white cross at upper right, a formal consequence of the checkerboard pattern (a recurrent motif in works of this period). In this instance negative space is treated as positive form. Once the cross of the title is seen, one begins to perceive throughout the work a proliferation of others, varying in degrees of explicitness. Though Kandinsky, like Kazimir Malevich, uses it as an abstract element, the cross is an evocative, symbolic form.  The viewer\u2019s compulsion to read imagery literally is used to unexpected ends by Kandinsky, who includes two signs resembling the numeral 3 upended and affixed to directional arrows. The variations in direction of the resulting forms suggest the rotation of the entire canvas.

These areas of black paint have been sparsely applied and blended with blue pigment, creating pulsating, hazy forms that give the canvas a sense of movement and depth.\r\n\r\nThis work was painted by the abstract expressionist artist Mark Rothko on a single sheet of tightly stretched cotton duck canvas. The canvas was primed with a base coat of red, made from powder pigments mixed into rabbit-skin glue.

The central black rectangles have a velvety blue-black base, \u2018modified with small amounts of cobalt violet and possibly manganese blue\u2019, according to curator and art historian Bonnie Clearwater (Clearwater 2006, p.179). These areas were painted in fast, broken brushstrokes using a large commercial decorator\u2019s brush, a technique that created the muddied edges between the blocks of colour. The glue within the red paint shrank as it dried, giving the surface of the painting its matte finish.\r\n\r\nRothko is best known as a pioneer of colour field painting, alongside fellow American artists Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still, among others. This movement was characterised by simplified compositions of geometric shapes in unbroken colour. Rothko began creating such works in 1946, initially working in vibrant colours, and this early approach to colour field painting is represented in the Tate collection by Untitled c.1950\u20132 (Tate T04148). In the latter half of the 1950s the palette of Rothko\u2019s paintings became more muted and sombre, as the artist observed in 1960: \u2018The dark pictures began in 1957 and have persisted almost compulsively to this day\u2019 (quoted in Alley 1981, p.657). As the hues in Rothko\u2019s work darkened, he also began to concentrate on the interplay between light and depth, as can be seen in Light Red Over Black, which uses the opaque frame of the border to form a contrast with the texture of the enclosed rectangles. This created the impression of moving planes and recessions, as observed by Clearwater:\r\n\r\nIn Light Red Over Black, Rothko paired two black regions; the top one is painted more densely and uniformly with defined edges, while the bottom black is more thinly painted and allows more of the red field below to bleed through. The diffused top and bottom periphery of this form creates an atmospheric effect. Consequently, the top black area appears to recede in depth and expand at its sides, whereas the black at the bottom projects forward.\r\n(Clearwater 2006, p.133.)\r\nLight Red Over Black was exhibited in the US pavilion at the twenty-ninth Venice Biennale in 1958 and was acquired by Tate the following year.

The lighter, lower rectangle shows the horizontal sweeps of a broad brush, while the upper rectangle contains vertical marks in a deeper tone, applied with a drier brush. These two fields are divided by a thin, pale, horizontal line. The shapes almost fill the frame, and are edged only by a white border of unpainted paper, which was uncovered when the tape that fixed the paper to a board during painting was lifted. The work is inscribed with the artist\u2019s name and date on the verso.\r\n\r\nThis work was painted in 1969 by the abstract expressionist artist Mark Rothko. He is best known, alongside fellow Americans Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still, as a pioneer of colour field painting. This movement was characterised by simplified compositions formed from geometric shapes in unbroken colour. Although Rothko worked in vibrant hues in his early work, made during the late 1940s, later the palette became more muted and sombre, as can be seen in his well-known \u2018Seagram Murals\u2019 series of the late 1950s (Tate T01031 and T01163\u2013T01170), which Rothko executed in shades of dark maroon, plum and black. In 1968 Rothko suffered an aneurysm of the aorta and on medical advice began working on a smaller scale, which precipitated many works on paper and a further paring back of form and palette. In earlier canvases, rectangular areas of colour hovered over saturated fields of pigment, whereas in the paintings on paper, such as Untitled 1969, the rectangles became the ground itself, while the paper\u2019s white edge served to emphasise both the flatness of the surface and suggest the possibility of depth.\r\n\r\nCurator Bonnie Clearwater explained that this austerity in Rothko\u2019s work was not accompanied by a loss of creative intensity:\r\n\r\nRothko painted very rapidly, and on a good day he could produce fifteen works on paper. Although in poor health he painted with great energy, moving his whole body, not just his wrist. Some of these works seem to have materialised effortlessly, the grays applied with a single sweep of the brush. Such works contrast with more labored paintings on paper which Rothko could not resist revising and editing.\r\n(Bonnie Clearwater, Mark Rothko: Works on Paper, New York 1984, p.52.)\r\nUntitled belongs to a series of works on paper that are often referred to as the Brown and Gray series. These paintings are characterised by a colour field divided into two unequal areas. In each case the darker tone is positioned above the lighter tone, a configuration Rothko imposed to prevent the works from being read as landscapes. The Brown and Gray paintings on paper anticipate the 1969\u201370 Black on Gray works, a series of around twenty-five paintings on canvas that formed the last major group Rothko made before his death. Rothko employed similar tones and configurations in this final series, but whereas in the paper works the white margin was created by the removal of masking tape, in the works on canvas he painted against a white canvas and, according to critic Brian O\u2019Doherty \u2018abandoned a life-long habit of \u201cturning the corner\u201d, of painting around the edge of the stretcher to give the canvas enough objectness to hold its place on the wall\u2019. (Brian O\u2019Doherty, Mark Rothko: The Dark Paintings 1969\u201370, exhibition catalogue, Pace Gallery, New York 1985, p.6.)\r\n\r\nUntitled was gifted to Tate in 1986 by the Rothko Foundation, alongside Untitled c.1946\u20137 (Tate T04147) and Untitled c.1950\u20132 (Tate T04148).

It was made from a black and white photograph that Dean took of one of the largest and oldest complete oak trees in England, massively enlarged and printed on four overlapping sections of fibre-based paper. All the area surrounding the tree\u2019s leafless branches and trunk has been overpainted with white gouache, isolating its structure and form. The title is derived from the name of the tree, which is also known as the Fredville Oak, after the estate in Nonington, Kent where it has been growing for centuries with two smaller giant oaks, known as Beauty and Stately. The first of these was also photographed by Dean; it and others in the series are similarly titled or named after the place where they grow: Monkey Puzzle, Crowhurst (reproduced Vischer and Friedli, pp.108 and 110) and Molash.\r\n\r\nDean\u2019s methodology is a combination of idea-driven research with an openness to chance, accident, coincidence and poetic associations which she allows to direct her processes. She has explained what drew her to \u2018old and deformed trees\u2019 in an interview with the novelist Jeffrey Eugenides:\r\n\r\nI made a photograph for an edition for October magazine recently called Fontainebleau Postcard, and I had to phone them up to check the title, and it reminded me that I had found all these old postcards of The Forest of Fontainebleau when I was in Kitakyushu in Japan, and I remember thinking that\u2019s so strange, why would they have so many postcards of Fontainebleau? And then I went onto the internet and I looked up the Forest of Fontainebleau, which lead me to the famous oak of Fontainebleau, which in turn led me to look up old oak trees and then the oldest of trees in England, the yew tree. Before I knew it, the tiny village where I grew up came up as the place where there once was a 1400-year old yew tree. I always need that tiny thread to get myself going.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Dean created a series of Deformed Trees (reproduced Vischer and Friedli, pp.101\u20133), painting over the background, and sometimes also the foreground, of old black and white postcards depicting trees. The postcards came from a collection she had been acquiring from fleamarkets all over the world since the mid 1990s. The application of white onto a darker ground has its origin in Dean\u2019s work with a series of drawings on blackboards initiated while she was a student at the Slade School of Fine Art in London (MA 1990\u20132). Her work Sixteen Blackboards \u2013 a grid of sixteen square photographs documenting the progression of imagery, including drawing, writing, collage and rubbing out on a single black panel (reproduced Vischer and Friedli, pp.56\u201365) \u2013 featured in the Slade\u2019s 1992 postgraduate exhibition. Elements of this, developed further by such works as The Roaring Forties: Seven Boards in Seven Days 1997 (T07613) \u2013 a series of drawings in white chalk on seven actual blackboards \u2013 are the precursors of Majesty and the group of photographs to which it belongs. The large areas of white overpainting on the photographs echo the patches of white left on the blackboards after rubbing out the drawings and text inscribed with chalk.\r\n\r\nDean continued to make work on paper during the following ten years, including the portfolio of photogravures The Russian Ending 2002 (P20246\u2013P20265) based on found postcards of disasters that she wrote on in white, and The Alabaster Drawings (begun 2002, reproduced Vischer and Friedli, pp.87\u201391), fine white lines following the veins on slabs of Italian marble. However, picking up the postcards of trees enabled her to rediscover a specific aspect of drawing that she felt she had lost (Vischer and Friedli, p.26). Although she trained in the painting department at the Slade, she quickly became involved in making films that have a painterly appearance but are structurally related to sculpture and space. Her film Baobab 2002 (Kadist Art Foundation, Paris) contemplates a group of baobab trees in Madagascar in black and white 16mm film, creating a series of anthropomorphising portraits while meditating on tensions between darkness and light."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 89, "fields": {"artist": 15, "title": "Beautiful Sheffield", "ymade": 2001, "medium": "Photo-etching on paper", "descr": "Beautiful Sheffield belongs to a portfolio of twenty black and white photogravures with etching collectively entitled The Russian Ending.

Probably long pauses, then all three worked on, from time to time. Experimented a little, for example, with having the \u201cwoman\u201d in the middle, and the \u201ccentre\u201d one on the right (even though it is larger), but came back to the group as it is now\u2019. The different dates of the three panels indicates that the artist saw them as a triptych only in the course of working on them. In conversation with the compiler at the Tate Gallery on 8 February 1994, Kiff said that it was difficult to be absolutely precise about the dates because at any one time he had literally hundreds of works on the go. However, he felt that the dates inscribed on the back of the panels were probably correct.\r\n\r\nKiff completed much of his work on T04888 by 1985, and a photograph of it in this still unfinished state was reproduced in the 1986 Arts Council catalogue. A comparison of this reproduction and T04888 as it is now shows that, after the photograph was taken, Kiff added small green shoots under the feet of the black figure in the central panel and, most noticeably of all, worked on the golden-coloured woman in the right panel, painting over white pastel lines and generally firming up the shape of the figure. Kiff continued to work on the triptych right up to the moment it was exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery. He may have made some tiny adjustments after the show, but, he felt, it was more or less complete at the time of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nT04888 is one of four triptychs begun by Kiff, and the second to be completed. Its left panel was conceived initially as a possible fourth panel for the first, \u2018Triptych: The Cry; Rain on the Sea; The Street\u2019, 1982\u20133 (oil and acrylic on board, 1140 \u00d7 2667 mm, repr. Ken Kiff, exh. cat., Nicola Jacobs Gallery 1983, [p.15, fold-out sheet] in col.). (When Kiff began work on these four panels, he was not absolutely sure whether they would become one or several works.) The first triptych and T04888 have a number of elements in common, although the function of these is different in each context. In the left panel of \u2018Triptych: The Cry; Rain on the Sea; The Street\u2019 there is a reddish monstrous figure, a partly formed green being, a sun and two houses. In the middle panel a man's head, surrounded by sea, watches as a cloud rains onto a skull around which grow some green shoots. (Kiff recalls that this panel was initially bigger than the surrounding panels, like the middle section of T04888, but was cut down at a certain point to the size of the others). In the right panel there is a figure, made up of a red trunk and legs and a green arm, and a clothed woman with golden hair holding a bunch of flowers. In between the two figures is a tall narrow shape, the colour of the hardboard, and a house. The upper part of the panel is painted white. At a certain point it became clear to the artist that the left panel of T04888 was \u2018not necessary\u2019 to the group of paintings that were to make up the first triptych: the third panel already embodied the idea of resolution with the golden-haired woman holding flowers and in the combination of the \u2018big complementaries\u2019, red and green, in the second figure. In conversation with the compiler Kiff said that some of the themes in the right panel of the first triptych were developed in T04888's left panel: the complementaries were given a new radiance in the brilliant colours chosen for the tree and dog; the house was repeated; and an echo of the tall, elongated shape, which in the third panel functioned as a path, river or a second arm of the red and green figure, could be detected in the shape of the tree. Kiff also pointed out how the main elements in the triptychs were arranged in a particular configuration: \u2018In every one of the triptychs the image of a woman is on the right. There is a disturbance of some kind on the left, and in the central panel some kind of confrontation is hinted at.\u2019\r\n\r\nBefore he began work on the first triptych Kiff had long been interested in bringing together separate images within a single work. A drawing entitled, \u2018The Pilgrimage\u2019, 1978\u20139 (repr. AC exh. cat., 1986, p.8) shows a tripartite division, and in conversation Kiff recalled that there were a number of other drawings from that period which juxtaposed separate images. However, the experience of working on the \u2018Sequence\u2019, a still incomplete series of over two hundred works on paper, was perhaps the mainspring behind Kiff's interest in triptychs. In conversation Kiff described the \u2018Sequence\u2019 as \u2018a way of thinking\u2019: it worked, \u2018by saying, look, in number one there is yellow linked to the idea of a hill, in number 105 there is yellow linked to the idea of a hill but it is used differently. In number 51 there is a hill and that is a kind of dead yellow ... So there are all these linkages and networks\u2019. In annotations on a draft version of this entry, Kiff added, \u2018the \u201clinkages and networks\u201d include elements that people would commonly call \u201cimagery\u201d and elements that would commonly be called \u201cformal\u201d. The point of calling it a \u201cway of thinking\u201d arises from the rarity of thinking which can not only accommodate \u201cformal\u201d and \u201cimage\u201d aspects, but as it were get underneath their seeming difference\u2019. The triptych format allowed this sort of pictorial cross-referencing to take place in relation to groups of three images, though, typically, the images were also intimately related to a number of other works.\r\n\r\nWhen working on the triptychs Kiff was very much aware of what he describes as the \u2018terrific tradition of triptychs\u2019. However, he was not particularly drawn to or influenced by this tradition: \u2018You just have to shrug\u2019, he said, \u2018and go ahead with it\u2019. In making the central panel of T04888 slightly larger than the other two, he was not referring to the traditional triptych format in which the two flanking panels serve as meditations on the theme announced in the generally larger central panel. He explained that when three panels are the same size, the central one can look smaller. To counter this optical effect he wanted the central panel to be slightly larger. As mentioned above, he had even experimented with having the panel with the golden woman in the centre, with the panel with the confrontation of the man and the wraith-like being on the right, despite its greater size.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with the compiler, Kiff said that one of the great influences on his use of a triptych format had been seeing a number of triptychs by the modern master Joan Mir\u00f3 at the Mir\u00f3 Foundation in Barcelona and in reproduction. He mentioned that one in particular, \u2018Fireworks\u2019, 1974 (Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, repr. Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, Obra de Joan Mir\u00f3, Barcelona 1988, nos.1208\u201310) had been a great spur to him.\r\n\r\nTalking about the way in which he painted T04888, the artist stressed the importance of the hardboard support. On a practical level, the board allowed Kiff to rework his images. \u2018You could not do the kind of atrocious changes I do on canvas - you would go through the stuff. I change pictures to a quite shocking degree with razor blades and sandpaper. One way of keeping a fairly stable, thin paint film is to sandpaper the stuff off. You can't sandpaper off on canvas.\u2019 The board also helped establish a tonal range. \u2018If you take that hardboard colour into a bright colour, you are likely to go towards yellow ultimately (in fact, that is exactly what I do). But you can, of course, bring it up to other colours like red. You can bring it up into green colours, but that is pretty different from hardboard. But there is always the feeling, if I am going to do that, that the hardboard is the stuff, the basic first image, the first resonant thing. Other things are going to gradually grow out of it.\u2019 The board conjured, in addition, a range of associations with particular types of art admired by Kiff. In a letter to the compiler dated 4 April 1987, he wrote:\r\n\r\nI saw the Byzantine museum in Athens about ten years ago and was very moved by it, and for years had a reproduction pinned to my wall. The bare and broken wood on which the gesso and tempera of those images has been applied - I mean as we now see them - joins in my mind with the brown cardboard in some Braque collage; this to me is the sort of thing that goes on in the painter's mind all the time.\r\n\r\nAnd, in the same context, he mentioned, \u201817th century paintings are often on brown, and old Chinese paintings on brownish silk\u2019. Above all, Kiff sees hardboard as equivalent to the support used in Cubist collages, an essential part of the image, with painted areas functioning in a similar way to that of the collaged pieces of paper."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 95, "fields": {"artist": 16, "title": "Person Cutting an Image", "ymade": 1971, "medium": "Tempera on hardboard", "descr": "The lengthy period of execution of this painting, from 1965 to 1971, is associated with the artist's choice of the medium of tempera and pastel. It is one of his earliest paintings in the style he now recognises as a part of all his subsequent work, and it was, for instance, the third in date order in his retrospective exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in 1986. The artist wrote (letter of 6 August 1984):\r\n\r\nAt the time when I began that painting, being very unsure where I was going with painting, I started working on gesso on hardboard so that the images could be scraped off or radically changed many many times, and yet a paintfilm which was clear, probably translucent, and above white, could be kept. I didn't see, nor do I see now, how this could be done with any other medium. Though I'd used tempera before, mixing it myself, with these paintings (of which there were six in all) I used Rowney's \u2018egg\u2019 (ie. egg-oil emulsion) tempera. It behaves much like tempera and was convenient for paintings which really have nothing of the laboriousness and attention to detail which the purist tempera painters usually have.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group of early paintings (in fact more than six) in this medium were shown at the Serpentine Gallery in 1986 as numbers 2 to 8, where they were dated from 1965 to 1979, and there is also, in addition, another painting \u2018Woman Taking her Clothes\u2019 (24 \u00d7 24 ins.) which was not exhibited since it was still unfinished. All of these were altered considerably during the painting, although \u2018Person Cutting an Image\u2019 less so:\r\n\r\nThe \u2018Man Cutting an Image\u2019 (like the pastel, which was begun earlier) was always a figure against a dark background. But other presences in the darkness, a window, the table and whatever was happening on it, all these things came and went, and changed the picture fundamentally. Doing two versions - I suppose always a way of thinking about what one is doing - may have had a technical point with this painting: a soft matt translucent black is easier in pastel or tempera than in oil (letter of 24 August 1984).\r\n\r\nThe pastel version (22 \u00d7 30 ins., private collection) has the same composition, but the table is a darker colour and the features of the head are drawn in a different way, as if also seen in profile inside the full round of the head.\r\n\r\nIn these two letters the artist gave no direct account of the subject, but described some of its associations:\r\n\r\nI hope that [these] paintings, having become whole as one works on them, become more serene for the viewer as he continues to look at them. That the black background dovetails into the figure, reaches into it as the head reaches into the darkness, or that other sharper black shape, the scissors, reaches into the image on the table ...\r\n\r\nAnd the general implications of the subject:\r\n\r\nThings being split apart, divided or even destroyed - I think I do a lot of subjects like that, but always I hope the real subject is wholeness, or the movement towards wholeness.\r\n\r\nThe image is related to that of another painting of similar date. \u2018Man Reading with a Paraffin Stove\u2019 (oil on canvas, 60 \u00d7 48 ins., 1964\u20135, collection of artist) shows a seated figure, full length and in a comparable pose, staring at a painting of a head that is probably his own, or even a mirror. A pair of scissors is open on the floor near his feet. That the \u2018image\u2019 he looks at is a self-portrait is far more explicit than in the Tate Gallery's painting, but there is a possibility that this identification is continued there as well."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 96, "fields": {"artist": 16, "title": "Night Clouds", "ymade": 1977, "medium": "Acrylic paint on paper", "descr": ""}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 97, "fields": {"artist": 16, "title": "The Face on the Tree", "ymade": 1978, "medium": "Acrylic paint on paper", "descr": ""}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 98, "fields": {"artist": 17, "title": "War", "ymade": 2003, "medium": "Pastel on paper on aluminium", "descr": "War 2003 is a large pastel work on paper, mounted on aluminium, by the Portuguese-born British artist Paula Rego. The image is dominated by two rabbit-headed figures in the centre, the larger one of which wears a blue dress and carries the smaller, who wears a frilly pink dress, has bloody marks around its eyes and mouth, and whose legs and arms resemble those of a soft toy. Behind these two figures on the left-hand side of the composition is an ant-like figure grappling with a brown hound, and a pelican embracing a woman. In the foreground stands a row of four figures: a stork with outstretched wings who has a talon inside the pink dress of another rabbit-headed figure, and a creature in a red dress with ribbons tied to its head glaring at a diminutive woman in soldier\u2019s dress. A lifeless child or toy lying on the ground by the central pair, and a sitting cat in the top right-hand corner, add to the ominous ambiguity of the scene. The background of the work is divided into three blocks of colour \u2013 yellow at the bottom, muddy terracotta in the middle and a foreboding dark blue at the top containing a plume of black. These bands of colour retain traces of Rego\u2019s sketchy mark making, in contrast to the figures, which are more heavily worked and consequently more opaque.\r\n\r\nWar was completed in London, where Rego moved permanently in 1976. The artist has claimed that the work was a response to a photograph published in the Guardian newspaper in the early stages of the Iraq War, which began in March 2003. The photograph featured a screaming girl in a white dress running from an explosion, while a woman and a baby remain stationary behind her. Rego explained, \u2018I thought I would do a picture about these children getting hurt, but I turned them into rabbits\u2019 heads, like masks. It\u2019s very difficult to do it with humans, it doesn\u2019t get the same kind of feel at all. It seemed more real to transform them into creatures\u2019 (quoted in Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda 2007, p.268).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the newspaper image, Rego worked from a sculptural tableau constructed in her studio (models for the two central figures in War can be seen in a photograph reproduced in Fondation Calouste Gulbenkian \u2013 D\u00e9l\u00e9gation en France 2012, p.51). The artist has suggested other sources for the figures in the work. According to Rego, the small woman in the bottom-right corner of War is based on a childhood teacher of hers named Miss Cook, who played piano in a casino bar in Estoril (situated just to the west of Lisbon, where Rego was born) frequented by refugees escaping the Second World War. In War this figure, in Rego\u2019s words, \u2018saves a whole group of people\u2019 (quoted in Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda 2007, p.268).\r\n\r\nRego\u2019s use of pastels in War reflects a shift she made in 1994 from oil and acrylic paints. The artist has connected the experience of working with pastels with the more tactile processes she employed earlier in her career when she would sketch or compose collaged elements on the ground (Bradley 2002, p.68). She has also suggested that a desire for layering and flux while working on an image led to her switching materials: \u2018Process is part of it, I don\u2019t want to get exactly what I want the first time, because, you see, the changing it, the pushing it around, shoving it, makes it come alive. Rather than just doing it the first time.\u2019 (Quoted in Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda 2007, p.192.)\r\n\r\nCompositions combining animals, young girls and children\u2019s toys, all of which appear in War, recur throughout Rego\u2019s work, which often invokes the imagery of fairy tales with sinister or gothic overtones. Art historian Philippe Dagen has suggested that War be considered as \u2018the nightmare which a child might have when the vision of death intrudes into its visual world\u2019, a vision which may be generated by books or films and which \u2018instantly perverts its previously happy and warm world\u2019 (Philippe Dagen, \u2018What War is Happening Here?\u2019, in Fondation Calouste Gulbenkian \u2013 D\u00e9l\u00e9gation en France 2012, p.5).\r\n\r\nWar was first shown as part of an exhibition titled Jane Eyre and Other Stories held at the Marlborough Gallery, London, in October 2003, alongside a triptych and a suite of lithographs based on Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s novel. This combination demonstrates the pattern of Rego\u2019s work in recent years: large thematic multi-part series and graphic works punctuated by individual images like War."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 99, "fields": {"artist": 17, "title": "The Dance", "ymade": 1988, "medium": "Acrylic paint on paper on canvas", "descr": "The Dance 1988 is a large painting featuring eight figures dancing in the foreground on a moon-lit beach. The figures include a group of three women of varying ages moving in a circle holding hands, two dancing couples (including one woman who seems to be pregnant), and a woman stood alone on the left-hand side of the composition. In the background on the right-hand side of the painting is a large, steep and craggy cliff, on top of which stands an imposing fortress-like structure, depicted in silhouette against a deep blue sky filled with inky clouds and a full moon. The work has a dream-like quality, heightened by its night-time setting, the lengthy shadows cast by the figures, and by Rego\u2019s unusual use of scale, with the woman on her own appearing to be much larger than the figures alongside her.\r\n\r\nThe Dance, which at the time it was made was the largest painting the Portuguese-born British artist Paula Rego had created, was completed in London, where Rego moved permanently in 1976. Rego has claimed that the idea to \u2018paint people dancing\u2019 was suggested by her husband, the artist Victor Willing (1928\u20131988), who died shortly before The Dance was completed (quoted in Tate Liverpool 1997, p.127). Rego has also claimed that Willing suggested adding male figures to the painting, which she then based on her son Nicholas (who sat for her) and on a photograph of her husband (quoted in Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, p.255).\r\n\r\nThe development of the composition of The Dance is recorded in eleven preparatory drawings in ink that Rego donated to Tate when the painting was acquired in 1989. These drawings show various combinations of dancing figures, from seven young women jubilantly jumping in the air (Tate T05541) to a mixed group strolling along a beach (Tate T05545), which is much closer to the final painting.\r\n\r\nThe Dance was planned to be the last painting in an exhibition of Rego\u2019s work at the Serpentine Gallery in London, alongside other works completed at this time such as Departure 1988 (which was destroyed in a warehouse fire in east London in 2004) and The Family 1988. Rego has explained, \u2018It was to have been the picture that would tie everything together, hung over the top of everything else\u2019 (quoted in Fiona Bradley, Paula Rego, London 2002, p.42). However, The Dance was not completed in time for the show, which opened in October 1988.\r\n\r\nMany of Rego\u2019s paintings seem to suggest mysterious narratives, frequently evoking childhood memories, family scenes, fairy tales and myths. The figures in The Dance may be seen in symbolic terms, as the curator Fiona Bradley has argued:\r\n\r\nOften interpreted autobiographically, [The Dance] plays out the ways in which a woman \u2013 the main character, larger than the others, to the left of the painting \u2013 may structure her conception of herself. The woman stands apart from the dancers, in a separate narrative and compositional space. As she looks at the viewer a variety of ways of being a woman play across the picture\u2019s surface. The three at the back form a matriarchal hierarchy, a happy triumvirate of child, mother, grandmother; a complete cycle of femininity. The other two define themselves in relation to their men \u2013 one courting, the other pregnant.\r\n(Fiona Bradley, \u2018Introduction: Automatic Narrative\u2019, in Tate Liverpool 1997, p.19)\r\nWhile the critic John McEwen has claimed that The Dance is \u2018wholeheartedly nostalgic, with no sense of menace or subversion\u2019 (John McEwen, Paula Rego, London 2006, p.168), Maria Manuel Lisboa, a specialist in Portuguese culture, has suggested that the shadowy structure in the top right-hand corner of the painting resembles a military fort on the Estoril coast in Caxias, situated five miles west of Lisbon, where Rego was born (Lisboa 2003, p.73). This fort was used as a prison and torture site during the Estado Novo (1933\u201374), a period of authoritarian rule in Portugal, principally led by Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, who was Prime Minister from 1932 to 1968. The presence behind the dancers of this dark and oppressive building, closely associated with the violence of the Salazar regime, might be seen to add a sinister edge to the scene."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 100, "fields": {"artist": 17, "title": "Nanny Small Bears and Bogeyman", "ymade": 1982, "medium": "Acrylic paint on paper", "descr": "Rego stated that \u2018to do a picture I always need a story to start with, although as I go along the story may change or the picture may change\u2019. The story referred to here was told to Rego by a friend and is based on Elias Canetti\u2019s autobiography in which his nanny\u2019s boyfriend threatens to cut out his tongue. Rego explained: \u2018the one who is most wicked is not the bogeyman but the nanny who has strapped him [the bear] up. She is so possessive and horribly evil that while I was painting the front bear another little bear appeared behind it.\u2019"}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 101, "fields": {"artist": 17, "title": "The Firemen of Alijo", "ymade": 1966, "medium": "Acrylic paint, oil pastel, charcoal, graphite, resin, ink, paper and aluminium foil on canvas", "descr": "This is a large painting depicting a group of surreal, brightly-coloured figures against a rich red and orange background. The figures are a mixture of human and animal forms combined with convoluted intestinal imagery and abstracted machine-like shapes reminiscent of the forms Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968) painted in his Brides and Nudes series of paintings in 1912. The title of Rego's painting is derived from a group of firemen she saw in Alijo, a small town in northern Portugal, while on holiday there over Christmas and new year 1965-6. The winter was the coldest on record; it snowed and the hotel Rego was staying in with her husband, the artist Victor Willing (1928-88), and her parents had no heating. Rego's father was terminally ill with cancer (he died six months later), her husband was in a bad mood the whole time and Rego said she felt 'a sense of the end of the world' (in unpublished conversation with Judith Collins, 2000). Leaving her mother in her room doing her hair, she wandered around the town and was struck by the poverty of its inhabitants. She saw the firemen outside a tavern huddled together because of the cold. They had bare feet and wore traditional Portuguese coats padded with straw. Their faces were black with soot. Rego has described the painting as a homage to their role in Portuguese society as unpaid volunteers. No figure in the painting is a representation of any particular fireman, but rather an expression of her feelings around that time.\r\n\r\nRego has said: 'I can only understand ideas in terms of human relationships - I don't understand political abstractions. People as characters are far more real to me.' (Quoted in McEwen p.76.) She uses her personal narrative and experiences to describe feelings around moral, social and political issues. Rego and Willing lived in Portugal between 1957 and 1962. In 1960 during a brief visit to London for the birth of her second child Victoria, Rego saw an exhibition of work by the French painter and father of 'Art Brut', Jean Dubuffet (1901-85), and was immediately inspired. The discovery of Dubuffet's work helped Rego to reconnect with the intuitive spirit of her childhood, giving her the confidence to allow her imagination free reign in large, childlike scribbles. The accompanying release of energy generated by this process resulted in bright colours communicating a vivid, raw energy. Shortly afterwards Rego began a new body of work, completing a painting each day and often incorporating collaged elements. Initially these were taken from magazines, but when she could not find what she wanted she drew and painted the image on paper and then cut it out. The Firemen of Alijo was made using collaged fragments onto which Rego had previously drawn in charcoal and pastel and painted with gouache and inks. On the left of the painting is a bare-footed man with a badger's head. To the right of him a human-type body topped by a profiled head emerges from an animal base derived from a reproduction of a seal. Balancing on the seal's head is a bird-like figure. The area above the ground, from which it is separated by a narrow green horizontal line, is filled with figures the artist sees as fighting angels. To create these Rego looked at books on medieval art since she wanted to reflect the medieval core of the town of Alijo. She has said: 'I get inspiration from things that have nothing to do with painting: caricature, items from newspapers, sights in the street, proverbs, nursery-rhymes, children's games and songs, nightmares, desires, terrors.' (Quoted in McEwen, p.72.) As she once stated, she paints 'to give terror a face' (quoted in McEwen, p.72)."}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 102, "fields": {"artist": 17, "title": "Flood", "ymade": 1996, "medium": "Etching and aquatint on paper", "descr": ""}}, {"model": "gallery.artwork", "pk": 103, "fields": {"artist": 17, "title": "Drawing for The Dance", "ymade": 1988, "medium": "Ink on paper", "descr": "The following entry discusses eleven drawings by Paula Rego, T05538-T05548.\r\n\r\nPen and ink drawing on machine-made white cartridge paper.
